## What is this?
This is the official **open-source** release of the **Project_JBMX map** — **map only (terrain, models, lighting)** without gameplay mechanics.  
Released by: **@MielonDev** and **@0Szysza**.

## Required credits (read carefully)
Every game using this map **MUST**:
- keep the `ScreenGui` named `License` (shows text: `This map was created by Mielon and Szysza`) visible immediately when the player joins (it's already in `StarterGUI` in both `.rbxl` files),
- include the following line in the game description:  `JBMX map — authors: @MielonDev and @0Szysza.`
